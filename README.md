# Hiragana & Katakana Flashcards App

This applications is designed to make you learn both Hiragana and Katakana at the same time. It comes from the concept that "katakana is just japanese cursive" and will try to teach you both at once. Of course this can be disabled too.

Instead of installing other apps and/or setup someones deck, I just made this confy app to help us learn.
Have a good journey!

## How to use it
[Go to the app](hiragana-katanaka.vercel.app)

- The app was mainly designed with mobile in mind.
- You can either learn "by waves", e.g. HA, HE, HI, HO, FU. Or just brute-force everything into your brain at the same time.
- You can close the app, when you get back your progress will still be there.
- When you've learned BOTH kana for a syllable, you've "mastered" it, and it'll stop showing.
- Of course you can always reset or try a new mode if you are confident.
- Every game will randomize the cards, so be ready.
